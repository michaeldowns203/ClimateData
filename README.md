This program analyzes climate data CSV files and prints the highest and lowest temperature anomoly, sea level rise, and average co2 concentration (from each respective file). 
Then, it cross checks the other files for their data on the same date (i.e. the highest temperature value is cross checked with the sea level and co2 data sets on that date) 
and prints the highest and lowest values along with the found values from the other data sets from that date. This is done efficiently by utilizing a left-leaning red-black tree.
